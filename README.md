# InterviewTestApp3
This is the starter code for a interview coding test. March 2017.

Prior to starting the test you should be familiar with the following topics.
You should be comfortable implementing these in code, so if itâ€™s your first time seeing these you should implement them at least once to get a feel for how these parts of the Android API work in practice.

1)	Parcelable
2)	Parcelabler (because implementing Parcelable by hand on more complicated objects is a pain)
3)	FrameLayout
4)	BroadcastReceiver
5)	Intent
6)	IntentFilter
7)	LocalBroadcastManager
8)	WeakReference
9)	Handler
10)	HandlerThread
